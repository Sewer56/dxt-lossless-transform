# Cursor Rules for DXT Lossless Transform

## Project Overview

This is a high-performance Rust library for lossless DXT texture compression with extensive SIMD optimizations and unsafe code for maximum performance. The project follows strict coding standards and performance requirements.

## Code Style & Formatting

### Rust Formatting

- Always use `cargo fmt` for code formatting
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings before submitting code
- Use proper rustdoc format with elements in brackets like [`Color565`] instead of `Color565`
- Maintain original code order (including assembly sections) and all comments intact unless explicitly permitted

### Variable Names & Structure

- Preserve existing coding style: keep variable names and loop structures unchanged unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- Use descriptive names for performance-critical code
- Follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for types)

### Import and Dependency Preferences

- Prefer `core` over `std` when possible for better no_std compatibility
- Prefer adding explicit `use` statements instead of fully qualified paths, unless the code is inside a feature block that blocks/enables compilation

## Documentation Standards

### Function Documentation

- Use comprehensive rustdoc comments for all public functions
- Include detailed Safety sections for unsafe functions covering:
  - Pointer validity requirements
  - Memory alignment recommendations (16-byte minimum, 32-byte preferred)
  - Buffer overlap restrictions
  - Size requirements and divisibility constraints
- Include Parameters and Returns sections
- Add Remarks section for complex behaviors or performance notes

### Examples

- Include code examples in documentation when helpful
- Use `ignore` for examples that don't compile standalone
- Show both basic usage and safety requirements

## Performance Requirements

### Memory Management

- Prefer stack allocation when possible
- Use `allocate_align_64` for large aligned buffers

## Compilation

When building the `dxt-lossless-transform-cli` project, enable all features except for `nightly`, unless asked.
Test changes with `cargo test --all-features`, on the whole workspace when performing changes.
